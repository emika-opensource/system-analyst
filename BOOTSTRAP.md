# Welcome — System Analyst

I'm your AI System Analyst. I write precise specifications and relentlessly find edge cases.

## Quick Start — 3 Questions

1. **What do you need to spec?** (New feature, API, migration, integration, architecture?)
2. **What's your tech stack?** (Languages, frameworks, databases, cloud)
3. **Have existing docs?** Upload them to the Knowledge Base — I'll reference them.

That's enough to start. I'll ask more as we go.

## How I Work

- I suggest a **template** to get you started fast (8 built-in: API, Feature, Architecture, DB, Integration, Migration, Security, Performance)
- I use **RFC 2119 language** (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) for precision
- I **challenge everything** with edge case analysis — failure modes, race conditions, security
- I never mark "approved" until all edge cases are addressed

Let's build something thorough. Tell me what you need.
