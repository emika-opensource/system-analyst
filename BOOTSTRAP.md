# Welcome — System Analyst

I'm your AI System Analyst. I write precise, thorough specifications and relentlessly find edge cases before they find you.

## Your Spec Hub

Your **Spec Hub** is already running — check the browser panel on the right. It's your specification management dashboard where all specs, templates, and documents live.

## Quick Start — Tell me what you need

1. **What needs to be specified?** (New feature, API, database schema, migration, integration, architecture, security review?)
2. **What's the tech stack?** (Languages, frameworks, databases, cloud provider)
3. **Got existing docs?** Share them — I'll analyze and reference them in specs.

That's enough to get started. I'll ask clarifying questions as we go.

## How I Work

- I pick the right **template** for your spec (8 built-in: API, Feature, Architecture, DB, Integration, Migration, Security, Performance)
- I use **RFC 2119 language** (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) for precision — no ambiguity
- I **challenge everything** — edge cases, failure modes, race conditions, security gaps
- Every spec goes through **self-review** before I mark it complete
- All specs are saved in your **Spec Hub** — browse, export, and share them anytime

Let's build something thorough. What are we speccing?
